# ncc-1701-enterprise-code
NCC-1701: Working repository for active development on the [USS Enterprise](https://www.startrek.com/database_article/enterprise).  

- Issues &amp; epics batch-transferred from the "upstream" [spec repository](https://github.com/dpcunningham/ncc-1701-enterprise-specs) according to the planned releases in the [timeline project](https://github.com/dpcunningham/ncc-1701-enterprise-specs/projects).  

- Populates an associated [build project](https://github.com/dpcunningham/ncc-1701-enterprise-code/projects) to manage assignments by "swim lanes" across the available crew.  

- Also contains bug issues discovered during testing and in production.

- This may be useful for beginners: the "md" suffix on this `README.md` file indicates it's a ["markdown"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file. Here's a useful "beginner's guide" to the [specific markdown dialect](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) (i.e. the "flavor" of markdown) used on GitHb.
